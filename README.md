# wsl2-gpu-docker-template
Template for creating a Docker container that provides access to a GPU for Pytorch

## Intent
Serves a simple Docker setup for local, containerized, Pytorch + GPU development with Jupyter.

## Local Usage
The main thing to remember to change is the absolute path to the `notebooks` folder to your local
path.
Otherwise, this can be cloned and used as is.
